What is OMNeT++?
------


OMNeT++ is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network simulators. “Network” is meant in a broader sense that includes wired and wireless communication networks, on-chip networks, queueing networks, and so on. Domain-specific functionality such as support for sensor networks, wireless ad-hoc networks, Internet protocols, performance modeling, photonic networks, etc., is provided by model frameworks, developed as independent projects. OMNeT++ offers an Eclipse-based IDE, a graphical runtime environment, and a host of other tools. There are extensions for real-time simulation, network emulation, database integration, SystemC integration, and several other functions. OMNeT++ is distributed under the Academic Public License.
