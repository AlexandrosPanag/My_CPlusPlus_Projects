Probabilistic Flooding Algorithm
-----

This work is an assignment that was given to us during the academic year 2021-2022 in the Advanced Network Lesson [704] in the Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, University of Ioannina.

About this assignment
----

A network of nodes in a random arrangement, where a packet starting from node 0 will be transmitted to all other nodes according to the probabilistic flooding algorithm.
Question 1:
Calculate the smallest possible value for the coverage of the antenna.
 
Question 2:
Show the differences with simple flooding* in relation to:
a) the number of packets sent
b) network coverage

To be used:
a) 5 different values ​​for the coverage distances of the antennas, starting from the result of G. 1
b) field 1000x1000
c) various probabilities (depending on the team)
