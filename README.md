C++ programming language was developed in 1980 by Bjarne Stroustrup at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in U.S.A.

Bjarne Stroustrup is known as the founder of C++ language.

It was develop for adding a feature of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in C without significantly changing the C component.

C++ programming is "relative" (called a superset) of C, it means any valid C program is also a valid C++ program.
