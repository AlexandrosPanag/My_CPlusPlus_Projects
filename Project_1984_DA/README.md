Project 1984 Data Structures & Algorithms
----


Create a project that reads every word from the ebook 1984.txt, capitalizes every word, finds & counts every word (with the use of the Dictionairy Array) & then prints every word from the book and how many occurances it had in total.


This assignment was given into the Data Structures & Algorithms Lesson in the academic year 2019-2020 this is my solution to the problem and it is intended for academic / knowledge purposes only.
